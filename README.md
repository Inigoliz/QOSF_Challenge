# QOSF_Challenge
Challenge for the application for the QOSF Mentorship Program.

I solved Task 1 using PennyLane QML API.

An explanation of the approach followed, the code used, and the results and discussion can be found at 'Task1_InigoLara.ipynb'. The full code can be found in 'task1.py'. The other documents are learning ressources and other draft codes.

**I suggest going through the Jupyter Notebook 'Task1_InigoLara.ipynb' to get a taste of the solution developped.**
